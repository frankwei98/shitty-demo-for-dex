# Before You get started

It's a shitty demo, you'd better be safe to play this with Dasdaq OneBox EOS Node.

So crap that you need to enter manually everything.

1. Auth your `eosio.token` permission to the Pomelo Contract
1. Issue a new `eosio.token` token with any symbol you like
1. Sell the token that created with the `eosio.token` contract in the React Page
